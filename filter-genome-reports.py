''' 
filter-genome-reports.py by Rohan Maddamsetti.

This script goes through the genome report in data/prokaryotes.txt,
filters for lines with complete genomes, and IMPORTANTLY,
replaces "GCA" with "GCF" throughout, so that only data deposted in NCBI RefSeq
is analyzed.

See the documentation here for details:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/docs/v2/troubleshooting/faq/#what-is-the-difference-between-a-genbank-gca-and-refseq-gcf-genome-assembly

Usage: python filter-genome-reports.py > ../results/best-prokaryotes.txt
